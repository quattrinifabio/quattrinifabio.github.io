    tldr: "Existing Styled Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) strategies fail to generalize to novel styles and have technical constraints such as maximum output lenght. We propose a novel framework that leverages a powerful text image representation model (a variational autoencoder) combined with an autoregressive Transformer to generate styled text images conditioned on textual content and writing style examples. Our approach, solely on a diverse, synthetic dataset of English with over 100,000 fonts, shows the capability to reproduce unseen styles in zero-shot. Moreover, our model generates images without background artifacts, which are easier to use for downstream applications. Extensive evaluation on both typewritten and handwritten, any-length text image generation scenarios demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.",

Our approach improves semantic and perceptual coherence in panoramas by merging diffusion paths and reprogramming attention layers, outperforming previous methods. ",

    tldr: "Most image generation models are incapable of generating RGBA images, required by graphic designers for composition in artworks. In this work, we propose a fully-automated approach for obtaining RGBA illustrations by modifying the inference-time behavior of a pre-trained Diffusion Transformer model, exploiting the prompt-guided controllability and visual quality offered by such models with no additional computational cost. We force the generation of entire subjects without sharp croppings, whose background is easily removed for seamless integration into design projects or artistic scenes. We show with a user study that, in most cases, users prefer our solution over generating and then matting an image, and we show that our generated illustrations yield good results when used as inputs for composite scene generation pipelines.",
